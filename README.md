# Comparing Regression Models

This lab compares the performance of different regression models on a shared dataset using scikit-learn. The models tested include:

- Linear Regression
- Ridge Regression
- Lasso Regression

## Objective

To evaluate which model best fits the data using metrics such as:
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- R-squared (RÂ²)

## Key Findings

- Ridge Regression provided better generalization than plain Linear Regression.
- Lasso Regression helped reduce overfitting by shrinking less useful coefficients.

## Tools Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- scikit-learn
- pandas

## My Role

I completed this lab independently as part of the Fall AI Studio program at Cornell Tech.
